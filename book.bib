               evaluation of Renewable Energy Sources potential and the
               financial analysis of RE investments. A GIS database with data
               on wind, topography, urban areas, and special activities has
               been developed and used for the evaluation of theoretical
               potential through the spatially continuous mapping of Renewable
               Energy Resources. The available and technological potential are
               evaluated by the application of availability and technological
               restrictions. The evaluation of economical potential is
               performed by a precise estimation of the expected energy output
               and installation cost. The financial analysis based on the
               Internal Rate of Return, identifies the financial viability of
               alternative investments. The evaluation of wind energy potential
               for the island of Crete, Greece and the financial analysis of a
               wind park installation are presented as a case study.",

  abstract  = "Renewable energy is clean sources and has a much lower
               environmental impact than other energy sources. In Turkey, solar
               energy investments have been developed rapidly in recent years.
               Site selection for solar farms is a critical issue for large
               investments because of quality of terrain, local weathering
               factors, proximity to high transmission capacity lines,
               agricultural facilities and environmental conservation issues.
               Multi criteria evaluation methods are often used for different
               site selection studies. The purpose of this study was to
               determine suitable site selection for solar farms by using GIS
               and AHP in the study area. The final index model was grouped
               into four categories as ``low suitable'', ``moderate'',
               ``suitable'' and ``best suitable'' with an equal interval
               classification method. As a result, 15.38\% (928.18 km2) of the
               study area has low suitable, 14.38\% (867.83 km2) has moderate
               suitable, 15.98\% (964.39 km2) has suitable and 13.92\% (840.07
               km2) has best suitable for solar farms area. 40.34\% (2434.52
               km2) of the study area is not suitable for solar farm areas.",

               the adoption of open source software and open data. In the
               geospatial domain, this is no different, and the last few
               decades have seen significant advances in this regard. We review
               the current state of open source geospatial software, focusing
               on the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) software
               ecosystem and its communities, as well as three kinds of open
               geospatial data (collaboratively contributed, authoritative and
               scientific). The current state confirms that openness has
               changed the way in which geospatial data are collected,
               processed, analyzed, and visualized. A perspective on future
               developments, informed by responses from professionals in key
               organizations in the global geospatial community, suggests that
               open source geospatial software and open geospatial data are
               likely to have an even more profound impact in the future.",
