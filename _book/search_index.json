[["index.html", "Technical Guide for Estimating Rooftop Solar Potential in a City Introduction", " Technical Guide for Estimating Rooftop Solar Potential in a City Einav Grinberg 2021-12-01 Introduction In 1990, cities accounted for 45% of global final energy use, but by the end of 2020, this share had risen to approximately 75% and cities release a similar share of global energy-related CO emissions. Today, most of the worlds energy supply is generated from fossil fuels, coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, and their use has a negative impact on the worlds economy, ecology, and climate.1 Therefore, the use and need for renewable energy resources such as solar energy, is increasing and becoming more possible due to the rapid development of relevant technologies and scientific knowledge.2 34 56 This guide introduces a step by step approach to map building rooftop solar potential in a city. The guide is intended for the use of city planners, infrastructure managers, and city data analysts. With the outputs of this guide, decision makers can make informed decisions to advance the implementation of sustainable and renewable energy solutions in their city.

Geographic information systems (GIS) within urban energy analysis and planning allow for the capture, storage, and display of detailed information. GIS has proven its effectiveness in assessing renewable energy generation potential and understanding the spatial dimensions of energy consumption within a city.7 Moreover, there is a growing distribution of open geographical data and open-source geospatial software. Open standards are a central element to increase interoperability, reducing costs of data and software tools, and creating equal opportunities for cities worldwide to address geospatial phenomena.8 Not all cities are aware of the robust open geographical data and open-source geospatial software, hence, this technical guide can support a successful estimation of solar rooftop potential in city buildings, and enable reproducibility for other cities. The guide is demonstrated on the cities of Rosario and La Plata in Argentina. Both cities are part of the ICLEI network and 100% RE project. Li, C. (2018). GIS for Urban Energy Analysis.

Openness in regards to information technologies is comprised of the following components: Open source software - free and open collaborative software development. Open data - freely accessible, distributed, and usable data. Open hardware - physical products and systems designed to employ publicly shared information. Open standards - specifications for hardware, software, or data developed in a transparent process. In this guide, we will use open source software and open data in the geospatial context. Open source geospatial software includes a broad range of libraries, tools, applications, and platforms developed and released under open standards. The most known software ecosystem for geospatial software is the Open Source Geospatial Foundations (OSGeo)10 that supplies essential libraries and validated software packages for geospatial analysis and visualizations. A popular software project from OSGeo is QGIS Desktop which will be presented in the next part of this chapter. Open geospatial data includes information that is collected collaboratively and publicly available online. This can be in by either paid or unpaid crowdsourcing, public participation for data collection, etc. The most widely known example of a global open geospatial dataset collaboratively maintained through a global community of contributors is OpenStreetMap (OSM),11 which will be presented later on in the chapter.

This dialog provides general settings to manage the appearance of layer features in the map (symbology, labeling, diagrams), interaction with the mouse (actions, map tips, form design). It also provides information about the layer, this is a good opportunity to check what is our layers coordinate reference system (CRS), here we can see the layer is in The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84).

For more information about CRS) Figure 2.7: Layer Properties Figure 2.8: Layer Information On the left side panel, we can see an option called Joins. Join is associating records in one table or layer with records in another table or layer through a common field, known as a key. The join between a table of data to a layer is based on the value of a field that can be found in both tables. The name of the field does not have to be the same, but the data type must be the same; you join numbers to numbers, strings to strings, and so on (for more information about data types). To join between the rosario_municipalb layer and the Edificios_Publicos_Rosario we will click on the + sign on the bottom left and the Edit Vector Join window will open. In this window we can select the table or layer we would like to join attributes from and what would be the Join Field of that table or layer and which field is associated with the same key in the target layer or table.

This calculator enables calculations, based on existing attribute values or defined functions, for instance, to calculate the length or area of geometry features. The results can be used to update an existing field or to create a new field. 3.3.1 Building rooftop area To calculate the building rooftop area, we will open the rosario_municipalb layers attribute table and click on the Field Calculator operator.

"],["what-is-sampling-and-spatial-sampling.html", "4.1 What is sampling and spatial sampling?", " 4.1 What is sampling and spatial sampling? Sampling is the process of selecting a part of a population to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. The characteristics could be the total or mean value of an attribute regarding the population.1516 In spatial sampling, we collect samples in a two-dimensional framework. The sampling scheme is designed to maximize the probability of including the spatial variation of the study population. There are different methods to collect a sample, in this guide we will focus and compare results between two sampling methods: Spatial random sampling - randomly selecting sample points in a study region, where each location has an equal opportunity to be sampled. Spatial stratified sampling - the study region is divided into groups a.k.a. strata by a collective characteristic of the study region (neighborhoods, land use, etc.). Then for each strata, a spatial random sample is collected and combined to one sample.17 Therefore, to estimate the total renewable electricity potential for a city, we can collect samples of rooftop buildings using QGIS and QMS. Important! to complete the analysis it is essential to have the total number of buildings in the city. This will be discussed in detail in section 4.4 4.1.1 Selecting a sample size When planning a sampling framework the first expected question would be - What sample size should be used? To answer this question the following issues should be considered: What parameters do we want to estimate for the population How much is already known about the population Spread (variability) of the population Practicality: how hard is it to collect the sample data How precise we want the final estimates to be There are various strategies to determine a sample size. We can use a census if we have a small population, use a sample size from a different analysis that is similar to ours, use published statistical tables and use a formula to calculate a sample size.18 In addition, there is an online free calculator to estimate a suitable sample size here. In this guide we will use the following formula to decide our sample size: \\[\\begin{equation} n_0 = \\frac{Z^2p(1-p)}{e^2} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(n_0\\) is the sample size, \\(Z^2\\) is the confidence level Z-score (can be found in this table), \\(p\\) is the estimated proportion of variability in the population and \\(e^2\\) is the margin of error, a.k.a. a confidence interval. **Usually when we have a large population but we do not know the proportion of variability in the population therefore, we assume \\(p=0.5\\) (the maximum variability). 4.1.2 La Plata sample size calculation For the city of La Plata, we will use formula (4.1) with a 5% confidence interval to estimate a suitable sample size. \\[\\begin{equation} n_0 = \\frac{1.96^2*0.5*(1-0.5)}{0.05^2} = 384.16 \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore the most suitable sample to collect for La Plata would be 384 building rooftops. In this guide we will collect two spatial random samples - 100 samples, 300 samples, and both samples combined to observe the differences and select the most accurate approach when estimating renewable electricity potential for the whole city. After spatial random sampling, we will examine the estimation of renewable electricity potential with spatial stratified sampling. The sample size for stratified sampling depends on the aforementioned issues. We can decide first on how to divide our buildings into strata and then use equation (4.1). In this guide we first compute 60 spatial random points in each strata for equal size stratification. Then we compute 95 spatial random points for the built up area and 5 points for the non built up area for optimal allocation stratification. The decision to use these sample sizes, is determined by the spread of the buildings in La Plata and the practicality of collecting the samples. Thompson, S. (2012). Sampling. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley.

(See 4.1) Figure 4.1: La Plata Administrative Border Next, we will go to the Vector Menu, select the Research Tools option and click on the Random Points in Layer Bounds. This algorithm creates a new point layer with a given number of random points, all of them within the extent of a given layer. (See 4.2) Figure 4.2: Random Points in Layer Bounds The algorithm dialog window opens and we will fill in the parameters according to our analysis. The input layer of the administrative borders of La Plata is called polygon_3, first we will create 100 random points in the layers extent and save the file as a shapefile by the name sample1. (See 4.3) Figure 4.3: Random Points in Layer Bounds Dialog We can see that the layer sample1 is uploaded to our QGIS interface. (See 4.4) Figure 4.4: Random Points in Layer Bounds Output Layer in QGIS 4.2.1 The QMS plugin Now that we created 100 sample points in the administrative borders of La Plata, we need to see where does the point fall. To do so, we will use QMS to add a TMS layer to the QGIS interface. There are many different TMS that are available in QMS (here), the ideal layer would be the one with a high resolution that was updated recently. In this project, we will use two TMS layers to compare and achieve the best accuracy while digitizing the building rooftops. Google Satellite Hybrid ESRI To add the QMS plugin to QGIS, click on the Plugins menu and select the Manage and Install Plugins option. (See 4.5) The Plugins Dialog will open, there we can see all the plugins installed in our QGIS, in the search bar we will type QMS and see if the plugin needs to be installed or already exists in the plugin library. (See 4.6) Figure 4.5: Plugins Menu Figure 4.6: Plugins Dialog To add the Search QMS panel we will right click on the menu bar and choose under Panels the Search QMS panel, the panel appears on the right side under the Processing Toolbox. In the search panel we can search for the QMS suitable for our project, here we see the QMS we need under the last used QMS, click add on the Google Satellite Hybrid and ESRI. (See 4.7 and 4.8) Figure 4.7: QMS Search Panel Figure 4.8: QMS in QGIS 4.2.2 Digitizing a sample with QMS Now that we have the sample1 layer and QMS layers in our QGIS interface, the next step is to create a new polygon vector layer. To do this we will go to the menu bar, click on the Layer Menu, select the Create Layer and there choose the New Shapefile Layer option. (See 4.9) Figure 4.9: Create Vector Layer The New Shapefile Layer dialog will open and we can fill in the parameters for our layer. This layer we will name sample100. (See 4.10) Figure 4.10: Create Vector Layer Dialog Next we will right click on the sample100 layer and select the Toggle Editing option. This enables creating new polygons and adding them to the layer. Once the option is set we can see under the menu bar many different editing options in the Shape Digitizing Toolbar (if this is not already added, right click on the menu bar and select the toolbar under the Toolbars option), each time we want to digitize a new polygon we will click on the Add Polygon Feature option. (See 4.11 and 4.12) Figure 4.11: Toggle Editing Figure 4.12: Shape Digitizing Toolbar - Add Polygon Feature Once the layer sample100 is editable we will open the Attribute Table of sample1 and select a point according to the id field and click on the Zoom map to the selected rows option. We will see that the point id = 49, falls on a building rooftop. In 4.13 we see that id 49 is selected, it is recommended to start from the lowest id to the highest, to remember which point was already digitized. Figure 4.13: Random Point ID=49 from the layer sample1 Then we will click on the Add Polygon Feature option and follow the outline of the building rooftop using the TMS layers to achieve the best accuracy possible.(See 4.14) Figure 4.14: Digitizing ID=49 in the Layer sample100 For more information about digitizing and editing layers click here. 4.2.3 Including the density factor Once a random point does not fall on a rooftop building we will digitize it to include it in our analysis as a density factor. We will digitize the point in a small triangle shape, so the polygons area will be under 30 \\(m^2\\). (See 4.15) Figure 4.15: Digitizing to include the Density Factor 4.2.4 Solar radiation and renewable electricity calculation Once finishing digitizing all the sample building rooftops, we will return to the steps described in chapter 3 and calculate the solar radiation and renewable electricity for the sample. (See 4.16) Figure 4.16: Sample100 Attribute Table with Calculations As discussed in 4.1.1 we will digitize another sample for La Plata following the same steps as in 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, this time with 300 random points. "],["spatial-stratified-sampling-with-qgis.html", "4.3 Spatial stratified sampling with QGIS", " 4.3 Spatial stratified sampling with QGIS If we look at the following map, we can see that the city has areas with more built up land than others. The most suitable stratification in this case, where we have no knowledge about neighborhoods in the city or other significant characteristics of the city would be to use a spatial characteristic and divide La Plata into strata by land use and land cover. Therefore we will create strata according to built up and non built up areas based on satellite imagery provided by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service global maps of land cover &amp; cover changes and related surface area statistics in QGIS. 4.3.1 Land use change raster To download the land use raster go to the following link - https://lcviewer.vito.be/2015 and select the download option to choose the area of analysis. (See 4.17) Figure 4.17: Land Use Map by Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Next, we will upload the land use and land cover raster layer to QGIS, similar to the steps in 3.1. (See 4.18) Figure 4.18: La Plata Land Use and Land Cover in QGIS Then we would like to keep only the part of the raster that falls under the administrative border of La Plata. This can be done by going to Raster menu, selecting the Extraction option, and clicking on Clip Raster by Mask Layer. (See 4.19) Figure 4.19: Clip Raster by Mask Layer Dialog The dialog window will open, in it we can enter our Input layer the raster to be clipped, the Mask layer which is polygon_3, and save the new raster as laplata_landuse. (See 4.20) Figure 4.20: Clip Raster by Mask Layer Output According to the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service global maps of land cover &amp; cover changes and related surface area statistics web browser, the pixel values that are between 50-60 are defined as built up area. We will reclassify the raster image so the pixels between 50-60 will be given the value 1 and all the other pixels 0. In the Processing Toolbox search bar we can search for the tool we would like to use - Reclassify by table. Then the algorithm configuration window will open and we can choose our raster layer laplata_landuse and the click on the Reclassification table parameter. (See 4.21) Figure 4.21: Reclassify by Table In the Reclassification table we will set the values as seen in figure 4.22 and after we press OK we check the Advanced parameters and make sure that the Range boundaries are correct. (See 4.23) Figure 4.22: Reclassification Table Figure 4.23: Advanced Parameters As a final step we will go to the Symbology of the laplata_landuse layer and change the Max value to 1. Then we can see clearly which part of the city is built up and which is not. (See 4.24) Figure 4.24: La Plata - Built Up and Non Built Up Area Classification 4.3.2 Raster to polygons To compute spatial random points for each strata, we need to convert the reclassified raster to two vector layers - one for the built up area and another for the non built up area. For this process, we will use the Raster Conversion algorithm Polygonize (Raster to Vector). (See 4.25) Figure 4.25: Polygonize (Raster to Vector) The Polygonize (Raster to Vector) window dialog will open and we will put the Reclassified raster layer as the input layer. (See 4.26) The out put can be seen in figure 4.27. Figure 4.26: Polygonize (Raster to Vector) Dialog Figure 4.27: Polygonize (Raster to Vector) Output Next, we will open the Vectorized layers attribute table and click on the Select features using an expression option. (See 4.28) When the dialog window will open we will create an expression to first select all the DN values that belong to the non built up area. (See 4.29) Then we can right click on the Vectorized layer, select Export, Save Selected Features As and save the non built up area as a vector layer in our directory. (See 4.30) Figure 4.28: Vectorized Layer Attribute Table Figure 4.29: Select Features Using An Expression Figure 4.30: Select Features Using An Expression Then repeat the process for the built up area. The result vector layers can be seen in figure 4.31 with the purple layer indicating the non built up area and the pink the built up area. Figure 4.31: Built Up and Non Built Up area Vector Layers Now that we have two strata, we will once again compute spatial random points as described in section 4.2, and then digitize them according to sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3.

If you have no prior experience with R or RStudio it is recommended to follow this Getting Started with Data in R tutorial. The methodology, calculations and equations in this section are based on the book Sampling by Steven K. Thompson published in 2012.

To achieve a better estimation we would like to divide the city into strata using an optimal allocation design. The optimum scheme allocates a larger sample size to the more variable strata and a smaller sample size to the more difficult-to-sample strata. Therefore, we will follow section 4.2 and compute more spatial random points in the built up strata and less in the non built up strata. After, we will add again the optimally allocated strata to RStudio and calculate the parameters for this sample, as described in 4.4.1 and 4.4.2. In this analysis for the built up strata 95 building rooftops were sampled, and for the non built up strata 5.

"],["comparison-between-sample-results-and-sampling-methods.html", "4.5 Comparison between sample results and sampling methods", " 4.5 Comparison between sample results and sampling methods Figure 4.32 presents the results of the different samples collected for the city of La Plata. The most important parameters when comparing between sampling results are the \\(SEM\\) / \\(SET\\) and the confidence interval range. Figure 4.32: Summarizing Table of Sampling Results In our results, we can see that the sample of 400 building rooftops had the lowest standard error estimation and a more narrow confidence interval range than the other samples. This means that the estimation of the total electric potential of this spatial random sample is our best estimate. It is important to acknowledge that the optimal allocation sample also provided a low standard error estimation, this may indicate that if we increase our sample size we can have a better estimation of the total.

The total annual renewable electricity production potential (for 37 buildings) is 14,921.49 \\(mWh\\), and the total annual electricity consumption is 1,388.016 \\(mWh\\), therefore the annual renewable electricity balance is 12,812.970 \\(mWh\\). Figure 5.1: Rosario Renewable Electricity Balance The minimum value for the annual electricity production of 37 municipal buildings, is 29.86 \\(mWh\\), the maximum value is 2,224.67 \\(mWh\\) and the mean value is 403.28 \\(mWh\\). The minimum value for annual electricity consumption for 34 buildings, is 3.064 \\(mWh\\), the maximum value is 414.480 \\(mWh\\) and the mean value is 40.824 \\(mWh\\). And, the minimum value of the renewable electricity balance, is -116.1 \\(mWh\\), the maximum value is 1810.2 \\(mWh\\) and the mean value is 376.9 \\(mWh\\). For all the buildings extracted from OSM in the administrative borders of Rosario, including the government operated buildings but excluding buildings equal to or under 30 \\(m^2\\), a total of 9,783 buildings, the total renewable electricity production potential is 1,449,576 \\(mWh\\). When estimating renewable electricity potential for the whole city of Rosario, the sampling design that had the best estimate was samples 1 and 2 combined with a total of 400 digitized building rooftops. The sample estimated a total of 9,704,559 \\(mWh\\) renewable electricity production potential with a standard error of 2,441,361 \\(mWh\\), and a 95% confidence interval of 5,679,532 \\(mWh\\), 13,729,586 \\(mWh\\) for Rosarios 357,126 buildings. Thus, there is a 95% probability that the total renewable electricity production potential for Rosario is between 5,679,532 to 13,729,586 \\(mWh\\). However, sample 2 with 300 digitized building rooftops presented less variation (\\(s^2\\)=15,541.21 \\(mWh\\)) than both samples combined (\\(s^2\\)=18,714.05 \\(mWh\\)) and produced the second-best estimate compared to the other samples collected. La Plata results The total annual renewable electricity production potential for La Platas 105 government operated buildings is 35,961.04 \\(mWh\\), where the minimum value is 9.998 \\(mWh\\), the maximum value is 5016.660 \\(mWh\\) and the mean value is 349.136 \\(mWh\\). For all the buildings extracted from OSM in the administrative borders of La Plata, including government operated buildings but excluding buildings equal to or under 30 \\(m^2\\), a total of 2,657 buildings, the total renewable electricity production potential is 44,6342.8 \\(mWh\\). The distribution of the renewable electricity production potential for the OSM buildings in La Plata- the minimum value is 6.801 \\(mWh\\), the maximum value is 10,541.243 \\(mWh\\) and the mean value is 167.987 \\(mWh\\). When estimating renewable electricity potential for the whole city of La Plata, the sampling design that had the best estimate was samples 1 and 2 combined with a total of 400 digitized building rooftops, the largest sample collected. The sample estimated a total of 185,069.23 \\(mWh\\) renewable electricity production potential with a standard error of 36,207.84 \\(mWh\\), and a 95% confidence interval of 125,374.03 \\(mWh\\), 244,764.4 \\(mWh\\) for La Platas 2,482 buildings. Accordingly, there is a 95% probability that the total renewable electricity production potential for La Plata is between 125,374.03 to 244,764.4 \\(mWh\\). Though, the allocated stratified sample with 100 digitized building rooftops presented less variation (\\(s^2\\)=25,362.42 \\(mWh\\)) and produced the second-best estimate compared to the other samples collected. This sample estimated a total of 72,761.47 \\(mWh\\) renewable electricity production potential with a standard error of 38,722.83 \\(mWh\\), and a 95% confidence interval of 8,466.42 \\(mWh\\), 137,056.5 \\(mWh\\) for La Platas 2,482 buildings.
