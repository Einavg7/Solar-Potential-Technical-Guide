A GIS database with data on wind, topography, urban areas, and special activities has been developed and used for the evaluation of theoretical potential through the spatially continuous mapping of Renewable Energy Resources. The available and technological potential are evaluated by the application of availability and technological restrictions. The evaluation of economical potential is performed by a precise estimation of the expected energy output and installation cost. The financial analysis based on the Internal Rate of Return, identifies the financial viability of alternative investments. The evaluation of wind energy potential for the island of Crete, Greece and the financial analysis of a wind park installation are presented as a case study.",

In Turkey, solar energy investments have been developed rapidly in recent years. Site selection for solar farms is a critical issue for large investments because of quality of terrain, local weathering factors, proximity to high transmission capacity lines, agricultural facilities and environmental conservation issues. Multi criteria evaluation methods are often used for different site selection studies. The purpose of this study was to determine suitable site selection for solar farms by using GIS and AHP in the study area. The final index model was grouped into four categories as “low suitable”, “moderate”, “suitable” and “best suitable” with an equal interval classification method. As a result, 15.38% (928.18 km2) of the study area has low suitable, 14.38% (867.83 km2) has moderate suitable, 15.98% (964.39 km2) has suitable and 13.92% (840.07 km2) has best suitable for solar farms area. 40.34% (2434.52 km2) of the study area is not suitable for solar farm areas.",

In the geospatial domain, this is no different, and the last few decades have seen significant advances in this regard. We review the current state of open source geospatial software, focusing on the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) software ecosystem and its communities, as well as three kinds of open geospatial data (collaboratively contributed, authoritative and scientific). The current state confirms that openness has changed the way in which geospatial data are collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized. A perspective on future developments, informed by responses from professionals in key organizations in the global geospatial community, suggests that open source geospatial software and open geospatial data are likely to have an even more profound impact in the future.",
